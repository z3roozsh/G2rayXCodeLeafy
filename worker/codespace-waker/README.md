# G2ray Codespace Waker

Educational use only: this helper is provided for learning and recovery experiments. Use it only in ways that comply with applicable laws, GitHub Codespaces policies, Cloudflare policies, and network rules.

This Cloudflare Worker gives you a manual wake page for one GitHub Codespace through GitHub's official Codespaces API. The `GET /wake` page is public so it can load in your browser, but `POST /wake` and the `/api/*` actions require your wake secret.

It does not keep the Codespace alive forever and it cannot bypass quota, billing, deletion, or account restrictions.

The browser page is a small mobile-friendly health dashboard. It has a large **Start Codespace** button, a **Check Health** action, route latency/status cards, copyable status text, a stop-polling button, a route history summary, a latency trend, and auto-refresh while the route is still settling.

After GitHub accepts the start request, the Worker waits for the Codespace state to become available, then probes the public `app.github.dev` XHTTP route. If the response says `route_ready: true`, the external route answered a usable XHTTP probe and the VLESS configs should usually be usable. If it says `route_ready: false`, follow the returned `next_action`; HTTP `404` usually means GitHub's port route is still settling, while HTTP `0` usually means DNS or the app route did not answer.

When the start request is accepted but the route is still settling, the API returns HTTP `202` with `ok: true` and `route_ready: false`. The browser page keeps polling health until the route becomes ready or you stop checking.

## 1. Create a GitHub Token

Recommended path:

1. Open <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=codespace>.
2. Give it a clear name, such as `G2ray Codespace Waker`.
3. Choose an expiration you can remember.
4. Keep only the `codespace` scope selected.
5. Generate the token and copy it once.

Token types:

- Classic personal access token with the `codespace` scope.
- Fine-grained token that can access the repo and has Codespaces lifecycle/admin write permission, if that option is available in your account.

Keep this token private. Do not commit it to git.

If you are using the G2ray panel, open **Option 15: Recovery / Waker Setup**. It will detect the Codespace name, generate a wake secret, and show these same steps inside the terminal.

Do not paste the GitHub token into G2ray. Put the token directly into Cloudflare as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The wake secret is shown once by the panel; save it privately and put it directly into Cloudflare as the `WAKE_SECRET` secret.

## 2. Configure Wrangler

Install or use Wrangler:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --help
npx wrangler --version
```

Copy the example config:

```bash
cd worker/codespace-waker
cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
```

Edit `wrangler.toml` and set:

```toml
CODESPACE_NAME = "your-codespace-name"
```

Example placeholder:

```toml
CODESPACE_NAME = "your-codespace-slug"
```

If you use the Cloudflare dashboard instead of Wrangler, add `CODESPACE_NAME` as a **Plaintext** variable.

Optional: add `CODESPACE_PORT` as a **Plaintext** variable only if you changed the panel's `XRAY_PORT`. Leave it unset for the default port `443`.

Optional history: create a Cloudflare KV namespace and bind it as `WAKER_KV`. Without this binding, the dashboard still works but shows history as disabled. With `WAKER_KV`, it stores recent wake/health events, route HTTP status, latency, route wait time, and last failures under a per-Codespace key so the dashboard can show repeated HTTP `404` settling and latency trends.

Quota survival history also uses `WAKER_KV`. When GitHub returns HTTP `402`, the Worker records the first quota block, latest quota block, estimated monthly reset, retention/deletion fields from GitHub, and the next later successful wake or health check. This helps confirm that the same Codespace survived into the next monthly reset.

Optional quota survival Cron: add a Cloudflare Cron Trigger only if you want automatic low-frequency checks while quota is blocked, then set `QUOTA_SURVIVAL_CRON_ENABLED=true` as a **Plaintext** variable. The Worker is disabled by default for scheduled events, checks at most about daily before reset, and only attempts a wake near the estimated monthly reset window.

Optional alerts:

- Add `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` as a **Secret** variable to notify a Discord channel.
- Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` as **Secret** variables to notify Telegram.

Alerts are sent for wake attempts when a wake succeeds, when the route is ready, when the route remains stuck at HTTP `404`, and when GitHub rejects the token with `401` or `403`. Manual **Check Health** calls record history when KV is enabled, but they do not send route-ready or route-stuck alerts unless they reveal a token problem.

## 3. Add Secrets

Create a long random wake secret. Examples:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
[guid]::NewGuid().Guid + [guid]::NewGuid().Guid
```

Store secrets in Cloudflare:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put WAKE_SECRET
```

Paste the GitHub token for `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
Paste your random wake secret for `WAKE_SECRET`.

In the Cloudflare dashboard, add both `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `WAKE_SECRET` as **Secret** variables, not plaintext variables.

## 4. Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Wrangler prints the Worker URL, for example:

```text
https://g2ray-codespace-waker.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

The panel accepts the Worker URL with or without `https://`, and with or without `/wake`. It stores the normalized `/wake` URL.

If you are using the G2ray panel, return to **Option 15: Recovery / Waker Setup** after deploy, paste this Worker URL, and run the panel's Worker test. This saves only non-sensitive Worker metadata locally so diagnostics and the recovery card know which Worker is configured.

## 5. Start The Codespace Manually

Recommended CLI call:

```bash
read -rsp "Wake secret: " WAKE_SECRET; echo
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${WAKE_SECRET}" \
  https://g2ray-codespace-waker.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/wake
unset WAKE_SECRET
```

Opening the Worker URL in a browser and entering the wake secret in the form is preferred because it keeps the secret out of shell history.

If you create a new Codespace, change region, rename/recreate the Codespace, or change the panel's `XRAY_PORT`, update `CODESPACE_NAME` and optional `CODESPACE_PORT`, redeploy the Worker, then return to panel option `15` and save/test the Worker URL again.

## Expected Responses

- `200` with `ok: true`: GitHub accepted or handled the start request.
- `route_ready: true`: the XHTTP route returned HTTP `200` or `400` during the Worker wait window, matching the panel's route-readiness classifier.
- `route_ready: false` with HTTP `404`: the Codespace started, but the GitHub route has not settled yet.
- `route_ready: false` with HTTP `0`: DNS, TLS, or the app route did not answer before the Worker timeout.
- `next_action`: the fastest manual recovery step to try next.
- `quota_blocked: true`: GitHub returned HTTP `402`, so quota or billing is blocking the start.
- `quota_reset_estimate_utc`: the next first-of-month UTC estimate for included-usage reset.
- `retention_period_minutes` / `retention_expires_at`: GitHub Codespaces retention fields when the API returns them.
- `retention_risk`: `safe`, `warning`, `urgent`, or `unknown` based on `retention_expires_at`.
- `survival_next_action`: what to do to preserve the same Codespace/configs through quota reset.
- `notification_status: "none"`: no Discord/Telegram alert was needed, or no alert channel is configured.
- `notification_status: "deferred"` / `notifications_deferred: true`: Discord or Telegram delivery is running after the response through Cloudflare `waitUntil`; check Worker logs if an alert does not arrive.
- `notification_status: "failed"`: notification delivery was attempted synchronously and `notification_errors` contains the delivery error.
- `401`: Wrong wake secret, or GitHub rejected the stored token. Check the JSON `error`, `reason`, or `token_warning` field to tell which side rejected the request.
- `402`: GitHub quota or billing blocked the start. Mark the Codespace as **Keep codespace**, wait for quota reset or adjust GitHub billing settings, then start the same Codespace again.
- `403`: GitHub token is rejected, expired, or missing the right scope.
- `404`: Codespace name is wrong or the token cannot access it.
- `429`: Either too many wrong wake-secret attempts hit the optional KV-backed Worker rate limit, or GitHub rate-limited the token. Check `reason` and `retry_after_seconds`.

## Security Notes

- Do not put `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `WAKE_SECRET` in `wrangler.toml`.
- Do not commit `.dev.vars*`, `.env`, or `.env.*`.
- Prefer the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header over putting secrets in URLs.
- Rotate the GitHub token if the Worker or Cloudflare account is compromised.
