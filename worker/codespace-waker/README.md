# G2ray Codespace Waker

Educational use only: this helper is provided for learning and recovery experiments. Use it only in ways that comply with applicable laws, GitHub Codespaces policies, Cloudflare policies, and network rules.

This Cloudflare Worker gives you a private manual `/wake` endpoint that starts one GitHub Codespace through GitHub's official Codespaces API.

It does not keep the Codespace alive forever and it cannot bypass quota, billing, deletion, or account restrictions.

The browser page is a small mobile-friendly health dashboard. It has a large **Start Codespace** button, a **Check Health** action, route latency/status cards, copyable status text, and auto-refresh while the route is still settling.

After GitHub accepts the start request, the Worker waits for the Codespace state to become available, then probes the public `app.github.dev` XHTTP route. If the response says `route_ready: true`, the external route answered a usable XHTTP probe and the VLESS configs should usually be usable. If it says `route_ready: false`, follow the returned `next_action`; HTTP `404` usually means GitHub's port route is still settling, while HTTP `0` usually means DNS or the app route did not answer.

When the start request is accepted but the route is still settling, the API returns HTTP `202` with `ok: true` and `route_ready: false`. The browser page keeps polling health until the route becomes ready or you stop checking.

## 1. Create a GitHub Token

Recommended path:

1. Open <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=codespace>.
2. Give it a clear name, such as `G2ray Codespace Waker`.
3. Choose an expiration you can remember.
4. Keep only the `codespace` scope selected.
5. Generate the token and copy it once.

Token types:

- Classic personal access token with the `codespace` scope.
- Fine-grained token that can access the repo and has Codespaces lifecycle/admin write permission, if that option is available in your account.

Keep this token private. Do not commit it to git.

If you are using the G2ray panel, open **Option 15: Recovery / Waker Setup**. It will detect the Codespace name, generate a wake secret, and show these same steps inside the terminal.

Do not paste the GitHub token into G2ray. Put the token directly into Cloudflare as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The wake secret is shown once by the panel; save it privately and put it directly into Cloudflare as the `WAKE_SECRET` secret.

## 2. Configure Wrangler

Install or use Wrangler:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --help
npx wrangler --version
```

Copy the example config:

```bash
cd worker/codespace-waker
cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
```

Edit `wrangler.toml` and set:

```toml
CODESPACE_NAME = "your-codespace-name"
```

Example:

```toml
CODESPACE_NAME = "animated-spork-wvr97qjxqjqwcg6xq"
```

If you use the Cloudflare dashboard instead of Wrangler, add `CODESPACE_NAME` as a **Plaintext** variable.

Optional: add `CODESPACE_PORT` as a **Plaintext** variable only if you changed the panel's `XRAY_PORT`. Leave it unset for the default port `443`.

Optional history: create a Cloudflare KV namespace and bind it as `WAKER_KV`. Without this binding, the dashboard still works but shows history as disabled.

Optional alerts:

- Add `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` as a **Secret** variable to notify a Discord channel.
- Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` as **Secret** variables to notify Telegram.

Alerts are sent when a wake succeeds, when the route is ready, when the route remains stuck at HTTP `404`, and when GitHub rejects the token with `401` or `403`.

## 3. Add Secrets

Create a long random wake secret. Examples:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
[guid]::NewGuid().Guid + [guid]::NewGuid().Guid
```

Store secrets in Cloudflare:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put WAKE_SECRET
```

Paste the GitHub token for `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
Paste your random wake secret for `WAKE_SECRET`.

In the Cloudflare dashboard, add both `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `WAKE_SECRET` as **Secret** variables, not plaintext variables.

## 4. Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Wrangler prints the Worker URL, for example:

```text
https://g2ray-codespace-waker.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

The panel accepts the Worker URL with or without `https://`, and with or without `/wake`. It stores the normalized `/wake` URL.

## 5. Start The Codespace Manually

Recommended CLI call:

```bash
read -rsp "Wake secret: " WAKE_SECRET; echo
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${WAKE_SECRET}" \
  https://g2ray-codespace-waker.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/wake
unset WAKE_SECRET
```

Opening the Worker URL in a browser and entering the wake secret in the form is preferred because it keeps the secret out of shell history.

## Expected Responses

- `200` with `ok: true`: GitHub accepted or handled the start request.
- `route_ready: true`: the XHTTP route returned HTTP `200` or `400` during the Worker wait window, matching the panel's route-readiness classifier.
- `route_ready: false` with HTTP `404`: the Codespace started, but the GitHub route has not settled yet.
- `route_ready: false` with HTTP `0`: DNS, TLS, or the app route did not answer before the Worker timeout.
- `next_action`: the fastest manual recovery step to try next.
- `401`: Wrong wake secret.
- `402`: GitHub quota or billing blocked the start. Wait for quota reset or adjust GitHub billing settings.
- `403`: GitHub token is rejected, expired, or missing the right scope.
- `404`: Codespace name is wrong or the token cannot access it.

## Security Notes

- Do not put `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `WAKE_SECRET` in `wrangler.toml`.
- Do not commit `.dev.vars*`, `.env`, or `.env.*`.
- Prefer the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header over putting secrets in URLs.
- Rotate the GitHub token if the Worker or Cloudflare account is compromised.
